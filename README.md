# Language Randomizer

A fun and experimental tool that randomly translates text through multiple languages. This project uses Python's tkinter for the GUI and the [googletrans](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) API for translations. While it's entertaining and educational, please note that it's not meant to be a serious translation solution.

## Overview

The Language Randomizer demonstrates how meaning can shift when text is passed through multiple languages in a "telephone game" style translation chain. You can force specific languages into the chain and control the number of translation iterations.

## Features

- **Randomized Translation Chain:** Translates input text through a series of random languages.
- **Forced Languages:** Option to force specific languages into the translation chain.
- **Customizable Iterations:** Adjust the number of translation iterations.
- **Graphical User Interface:** User-friendly interface built with tkinter.
- **Help & Options Dialogs:** Easy access to instructions and language options.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar indicating the translation process.

## Folder Structure

```
language_randomizer/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.py           # Entry point of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ translator.py    # Contains functions for translation logic and language randomization
â”œâ”€â”€ gui.py           # Manages the graphical user interface
â”œâ”€â”€ options.py       # Implements the options dialog for forced languages
â””â”€â”€ help_window.py   # Implements the help dialog window
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language_randomizer.git
   cd language_randomizer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Install the required package using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install googletrans==4.0.0rc1
   ```

   *Note:* The `tkinter` module is bundled with Python on most platforms.

## Usage

Run the application by executing:

```bash
python App.py
```

Once the GUI appears:
- Enter your text in the "Input:" field.
- Select the target language from the dropdown.
- Adjust the number of iterations for translation.
- Optionally, open the Options dialog to force specific languages.
- Click on "Translate Text" to start the translation chain.
- Use the Help button ( ? ) for more detailed instructions.
